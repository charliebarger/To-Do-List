# To-Do List

## Description

A to-do list app that allows the user to add new project folders as well as tasks within those folders. Tasks are able to display the Title, Date, Priority, and Description on Click. Project Folders and Tasks can both be created, edited, selected and deleted. Local Storage is used to store the data.
