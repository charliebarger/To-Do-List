# To-Do List
## Live Page > [To-Do List](https://charliebarger.github.io/To-Do-List/)
This is a To-Do list made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows the user to add new project folders as well as tasks 
within those folders. Tasks are able to display the Title, Date, Priority, and Description (on Click). They can be created, edited, selected and deleted.
Dates are formatted using Date-fns.

Local Storage is implemented to save the users data locally. A default set of "Chores" is displayed on first visit in order to show how the application 
could be used.
